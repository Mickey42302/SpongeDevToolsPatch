# Development Tools Patch (Java Edition)
In Java Edition, there are a bunch of development tools that are locked away by default. This mod re-enables them, allowing you to get a look at what Mojang uses to develop the game!

This plugin is a rewrite of the original Dev Tools Unlocker mod (https://modrinth.com/mod/dev-tools-unlocker).

## Developer Commands

*Note: The "/chase" command is not available by default, even on development builds of the game. If you wish to enable this feature, please use the "CHASE_COMMAND" debug property (**Learn more:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2dVp0A3uwM).*

The following commands are available on both singleplayer and multiplayer:

• /debugmobspawning (**Learn more:** https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZWrxKFf1Xx4)

• /debugpath (**Learn more:** https://youtube.com/watch?v=9g2WI6V-W_A)

• /raid

• /spawn_armor_trims (**Warning**: This command can cause a lot of lag!)

• /serverpack (**Warning:** Incorrectly using this command can trigger an exception!)

• /warden_spawn_tracker

The following commands are only available on multiplayer:

• /debugconfig (**Warning:** This command will softlock the game if it is not used properly!)

*Tip: The developer commands can be enabled on vanilla installations using the "DEV_COMMANDS" debug property.*

## Sub-commands

The following sub-commands are available on both singleplayer and multiplayer:

• /test export <test>

• /test exportclosest

• /test exportthese

• /test exportthat

## Test Instance Blocks

This mod re-enables the "Export Structure" option in Test Instance Blocks. This option can be used to export data to an SNBT file within the "Minecraft.Server" directory.

*Note: Although the functionality is enabled, the client must also have a patch installed for the button to be accessible. This can be done by installing the Fabric or Forge/NeoForge version on your client.*

## Exports

Structure data that has been exported to an SNBT file is able to be loaded across different worlds. This can be done using a Structure Block or the "/place" command.

For example, to place a structure that has been exported to an SNBT file named "cookies", the following command can be used:

• /place template minecraft:minecraft/structure/cookies

## Test Worlds

The "Create Test World" button on the title screen can be used to quickly generate a world with settings that are designed to make testing easier.

*Note: This feature is unique to clients.*

## Logs

The game will print debug messages to the log files.

## Installation

To install this mod, place the JAR file in your "mods" or "plugins" directory.

*Note: For servers that don't use Sponge, the development features can be enabled by overriding the "IS_RUNNING_IN_IDE" flag to true. Depending on what server engine you are using, you may need to override the "isDevelopment" flag instead.*
